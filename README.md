# loop-bender

A GUI for tuning controllers in SISO systems. The aim of the project is to offer a quick a complete visualization of the effect
of tuning parameters in a controller, no matter it is a PID, a lead-lag, lag-lead or arbitrary positioning of poles and zeros.

By showing instantly the effect of the tuning, an intuitive feeling can be gained.
